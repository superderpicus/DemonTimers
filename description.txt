[size=20][color=#FFCC00][b]Demon Timers (v3) (by taters)[/b][/color][/size]
Individual demon timers all in one aura. No need for dynamic group.
This aura also features fully fleshed author options, allowing full customization to suit your needs.
[b]If you encounter any issues, or have any feedback, don't comment it here because I don't read it. Instead, send it to my discord taters#0001.[/b]

Icon Version: [url]https://wago.io/DemonTimers(Icon)[/url]

So, there are some cool new options! This should make it a lot easier for many people to modify the timers to their liking.
To test the print feature without doing the appropriate content, utilize the following macros:
/run WeakAuras.ScanEvents('DEMON_TIMERS_FORCE_START')
/run WeakAuras.ScanEvents('DEMON_TIMERS_FORCE_END')

[size=15][color=#FFCC00][b]How to Use Options[/b][/color][/size]

[size=15][b][color=#FFCC00]General Options[/color][/size][/b]
[table]
[tr][th]Option Name[/th][th]What It Does[/th][/tr]
[tr][td]Debug[/td][td]Enables a few print messages to chat[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Vertical Spacing Between Bars[/td][td]Pixels of spacing between bars when offset[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Number of Bars Per Row[/td][td]Number of Bars until it creates a new column[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Decimal Precision In Display[/td][td]Number of decimals to show on timers[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Imp Activity Delay[/td][td]With the new method of imp tracking, they are automatically removed from active clumps based on their activity. If they haven't been active since the activity delay, they will be despawned[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Use Cast Time Instead[/td][td]Instead of using a static number provided by the previous option, note the expected cast time and use that as the delay[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Auto Update Interval[/td][td]If the demons have not been updated since this interval, it will automatically run an update[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Imp Summon Delay[/td][td]When imps are spawned, if they are within this delay of each other, they will form a cluster, or 1 imp bar[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Imp Despawn Delay[/td][td]This option is mainly meant for use with the 'Filler' imps option. The imp cluster will stay active until this delay is over, preventing filler imps from showing false positives[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Imp Update Mode[/td][td]Toggle between 2 different update modes to handle imps[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Update Interval[/td][td]The interval is the general time to 'tick'. Every x seconds it will check which clumps need to be updated, and if it is flagged for updating, and the timer is up, it will update the state[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Update Window[/td][td]When an imp does an activity that would normally update it, it will instead flag the clump for updating after time + x seconds. Each clump may only be flagged once until it is updated[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Horizontal Growth[/td][td]Which way to grow if the column is full[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Sorting[/td][td]Which way to sort the demons. Based off of the 'Order' variable, and remaining time within the same order value[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Vertical Growth[/td][td]Which way to grow the bars vertically[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Show Filler Imps[/td][td]When imps are not active they are discarded, whether they should exist or not. Imps that should exist but dont fall under 'filler', and this option will show a seperate state with the count of imps that dont exist but should[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Only Not In Combat[/td][td]Filler imps can be kind of janky, so I created this option to only show them out of combat[/td][/tr]

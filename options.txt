After some revision, I have moved many of the previously available options. You will find |cffffcc00COLOUR|r in the conditions tab, and you can set |cffffcc00TEXT|r in the display tab: |cff00ff00text1|r is the display text showing the name, and |cff00ff00text 2|r will be where you input the imp replacements.

The conditions have also been expanded, allowing for more customizability for users, such as checking if an imp cluster has more than 3 imps, then you most likely got a horned nightmare proc, etc. Mess around however you like.
